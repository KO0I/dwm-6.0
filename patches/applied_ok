APPLIED PATCHES

nametag:    use dmenu to name tags. Prepends with tag number
pertag:     Each tag can have its own layout. Very useful!
columns:    New orientation for the master panel, makes verticals
flt color:  Border of floating windows have unique color
smfact:     Mod|Shift h and l can change smfact. Modified to work in
              columnar mode

cfacts:     Fine-tune space use(!)

Applied, but not really that great:
pango:        Allows unicode in bars. Requires reconfig of congig.h!
hide vacant:  Do not show unused tags. Issues with smfact :(

Stubbornly won't work:
statuscolors:   Long-term irritant
