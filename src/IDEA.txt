Idea 1: have a way to select a window, press a key combo, and XSetClassHint
such that dwm will:

  1. Note the WM_CLASS, name, all relevant details
      a. Print out what those are first?
  2. Find all windows that match WM_CLASS and other unique parameters, and
      then use XSetClassHint so that they always float, for example.

The goal is to get menus and dumb, pointless extra interfaces that are
designed to float (but don't because the programmers likely didn't bother to
make that happen for the sake of ICCCM standards) to always float instead of
tile. Windows with this property might also have a color cue to distinguish it from
ordinarily floating windows.

I cannot go through a process whereby I am always adding to the dwm
configuration file and recompiling. That's beyond inconvenient, because the
tools I work with generate dozens of these damn things. I'd rather mark the
windows as I go rather than have to stop and manually examine the output of
xprop so I can make a filter rule.

There's an even worse problem, and one of these days I need to actually sit
down and sample these and pore over the files.
